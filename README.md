Sunday Game Dev #2
==================

Me and some friends decided to get together on random sunday afternoons and try to code something we never coded before (basically, games). 

This is the second of such sundays and I tried to do a 3D engine from scratch, figuring out perspective transformations as I go along. This should be fun :)

If I manage to get a basic 3D engine up during the afternoon, I'll try and make some kind of first-person game.  *fingers crossed*
